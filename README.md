## State Management

SplitSync uses React's built-in state management capabilities:

- **useState**: For component-level state management
- **useEffect**: For side effects and lifecycle management
- **useContext**: For global state sharing (theme, sound settings)
- **Custom Hooks**: For reusable state logic (useSound, use-mobile)

### Data Flow

1. User interactions trigger state updates
2. State changes propagate through the component tree
3. Components re-render with updated data
4. Effects run to handle side effects (localStorage, notifications)

### Custom Hooks

- **[useSound](src/hooks/useSound.ts)**: Manages audio feedback for user interactions
- **use-mobile**: Detects mobile device usage

## Data Persistence

All data is stored locally in the browser using localStorage:

- **Recent Activity**: Expense history and status
- **Expense Groups**: Group information and participants
- **Payment Reminders**: Reminder status and details
- **Financial Insights**: Budgets and savings goals
- **User Preferences**: Theme settings and UI preferences

### Data Structure

```javascript
// Recent Activity
{
  name: "Dinner at Zomato",
  amount: "‚Çπ1,200",
  split: 4,
  status: "pending"
}

// Expense Groups
{
  id: 'group-1',
  name: 'Roommates',
  description: 'Monthly shared expenses for apartment',
  color: 'from-blue-500 to-cyan-500',
  participants: ['You', 'Alice', 'Bob'],
  createdDate: new Date(),
  totalExpenses: 3,
  totalAmount: 4500
}

// Payment Reminders
{
  id: "1",
  debtorName: "You",
  creditorName: "Alice",
  amount: 300,
  dueDate: new Date(),
  status: "pending"
}

// Financial Insights - Budgets
{
  id: "1",
  category: "Food & Dining",
  allocated: 5000,
  spent: 4200,
  color: "bg-red-500"
}

// Financial Insights - Savings Goals
{
  id: "1",
  name: "Vacation Fund",
  target: 50000,
  current: 35000,
  deadline: "2024-12-31"
}
```

### Data Deduplication

The application implements deduplication logic to prevent duplicate entries in recent activity:

```typescript
// Remove duplicates based on name and amount, keeping the first occurrence
const seen = new Set();
const uniqueActivity = parsedActivity.filter((activity: RecentActivity) => {
  const key = `${activity.name}-${activity.amount}`;
  if (seen.has(key)) {
    return false;
  }
  seen.add(key);
  return true;
});
```

## API Integration

SplitSync is a client-side application with no external API dependencies. All data processing happens locally in the browser.

### Future API Integration Plans
